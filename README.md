#Simple Calculator by Shane

This is a simple calculator I made in c++, this is the second iteration of a first calculator which I will not be publishing due the fact it was not all that great. Despite that I made a better calculator that achieves the same thing but is better organized, if you would like to install it... don't, just use desmos. But if you really want to, the instructions are below.

Windows
---------
1.Download the .exe

2.Run the .exe

Linux
---------
1.Download the source files

2.Unzip

3.Enter terminal into the same directory as the files

4.Use the command 
    
`gcc main.cpp -o main`

5.Run the new 'main' file
